The repository is a personal homework assignment of the algorithms course. The project was created solely to reflect the educational activities in the 1st year of the master's program. The author is not responsible for the actions of people who decide to submit assignments at someone else's expense by providing the code from this repository.

Task 1. Experimental time complexity analysis


Task 2. Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Direct methods


Task 3. Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. First- and second order methods


Task 4. Algorithms for unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Stochastic and 
metaheuristic algorithms


Task 5. Algorithms on graphs. Introduction to graphs and basic algorithms on 
graphs


Task 6. Algorithms on graphs. Path search algorithms on weighted graphs


Task 8:


I. Choose two algorithms (interesting to you and not considered in the course) 
from the above-mentioned book sections.


II. Analyse the chosen algorithms in terms of time and space complexity, design 
technique used, etc. Implement the algorithms and produce several experiments. 
Analyse the results.
